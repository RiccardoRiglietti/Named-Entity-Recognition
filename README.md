# Named-Entity-Recognition

Named Entity Recognition is the task of locating and classifying named entities mentioned in text. This task requires a neural approach because of the ambiguity of natural language: (ex: "The Yellow Submarine is a good song" vs "I saw a yellow bird": in the first case yellow is (part of) a named entity, in the second case it isn't). In the task we only had lowercase input.
